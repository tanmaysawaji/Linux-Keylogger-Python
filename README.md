# Linux-Keylogger-Python

This code runs in the background and stores keystrokes in a log file

Author : Tanmay Sawaji

This was something I worked on to make a log of all the activities done in a session

The pyxhook library is necessary for this, it can be easily installed using 
#pip install pyxhook

The code works only for linux and it is tested on Ubuntu 18.04

The file path is given in log_file

NOTE: Change the file path in the variable log_file or else the code might not work.
